# Exploring Polis for HIACT

This project is based on work by The Computational Democracy Project (https://github.com/compdemocracy), which is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license. 
The Computational Democracy Project (CDP) provide the Pol.is platform for the support of demogratic policy making.

In the current project I explore, test, and modify code by CDP to assess its suitability for use in the HIACT project (https://hi-act.ac.uk/), a project to explore the potential of introducing hydrogen and alternative fuels in various sectors in the UK. Public opinion plays an important role in this project.
